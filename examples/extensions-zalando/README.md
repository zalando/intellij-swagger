# Swagger Plugin Zalando Extension
Zalando's architecture centers around microservices, and each API is documented with a Swagger specification. Zalando has its own [API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines) that extends the standard Swagger specification. This extension example illustrates how the Swagger Plugin can be extended to support Zalando specific guidelines for REST APIs.

Developing the Swagger Plugin is easy, just execute the following command:

This will start IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin installed.
