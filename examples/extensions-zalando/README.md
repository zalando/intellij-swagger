# Zalando OpenAPI Editor with Zalando Extensions
Zalando's architecture centers around microservices, and each API is documented with an OpenAPI specification. Zalando has its own [API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines) that extends the standard OpenAPI specification. This extension example illustrates how the Zalando OpenAPI Editor can be extended to support Zalando specific guidelines for REST APIs.

## Development

### Running the IDE
To start IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin installed:
```sh
./gradlew runIde
```

### Plugin verification
To verify the plugin against different IDEA versions run:
```sh
./gradlew runPluginVerifier
```
This will output information of compatibility and also create reports under `./build/reports/pluginVerifier/`.

Generic verification:
```sh
./gradlew check
```

### Releasing
See `./release.sh`

###
Check dependency updates (preferably replaced with Dependabot):

```sh
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```
